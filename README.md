# Artificial-Neural-Networks-Design
This repository contains my bachelor thesis report from 2023, Artificial Neural Networks Design: Exploration Toward Efficient Image Classification. The project explores hyperparameter tuning in neural networks to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Given the limitations of training data and hardware constraints, achieving 100% accuracy is often unrealistic. Instead, the focus is on optimizing neural networks for real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments like embedded systems, where careful hyperparameter selection improves both performance and energy efficiency.
